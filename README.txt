This project is about embedding a youtube-video in a page and styling it to look roughly similar to youtube.

Now the project is mainly finished. Only some tweaks and polish to be done.

I learned a lot doing this project.
Prior to this, I very often assigned id's to an element and styled it via the id. This is not optimal because id's have high specificity and relying heavily on them therefore limits your options to overwrite styles.
In this project I tried to apply my styles using lower specificity, using mainly element and class selectors. I quickly ran into problems because the styles that fit one specific element were unwanted on the same element in another section of the page. Combinator selectors help a bit with this, but nevertheless the stylesheet soon becomes quite bloated and it gets more and more difficult to stay on top of which rule overwrites which other rule. Of course, this problem was greatly exacerbated by the fact that I didn't plan much (except the basic layout of the page) before starting to code. The planning is of course a bit harder when you build a mockup of a page instead of creating your own page - but it's surely possible to take a closer look at the page you're copying and thinking about which common styles apply to which parts of the page.
I found it very helpful to define utility-classes (like border-bottom that adds a gray line below an element) and apply them where needed. Generally I think it now best to use element selectors only for really basic stuff that should be the same for nearly every instance of the given element and use (utility) classes for the majority of the other stuff. For future projects it will be very helpful to think and plan first what kind of "building blocks" I want/need for my page (different kinds of headings, something like primary text, secondary text etc.)
